This project is a digital cookbook which main theme revolves around generating recipes from ingredients users have in their pantry or refrigerator.

This project was built with love using C# and the ASP.NET framework.

## Motivation

The inspiration behind this project is derived from the common headache of deciding on what dish to prepare. When they finally decide on a recipe, they find themselves realizing that they either don't have the right ingredients or that they don't have enough of them. So now they have to go out, haphazardly purchasing more ingredients, unless they decide on a different recipe.

The project aims to calm that frustration: it lets users weigh out their options, simplify their meal planning process, and encourage them to choose healthier meals.

## The project

The project has a multitude of features such as the ingredient-to-recipe generator (the project's main feature), recipe creation, recipe filtering, ability to bookmark recipes for ease of access, allowing users to view a recipe's step-by-step instructions and watch an accompanying video, a feedback feature that allows users to leave reviews for the recipe and rate them, letting users print out a (shopping) list of ingredients, and authentication.

Originally, this project served as our final project in our C# programming class, ENTPROG.

## Future milestones

-   A cleaner design
-   Ability to filter recipes by user and by ratings
